# Dashboard Component Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Dependencies**
- Added `react-router-dom` to package.json
- Material-UI was already installed

### 2. **Next.js Theme Provider Issue**
- Original issue: Material-UI ThemeProvider was causing build errors due to function serialization
- **Solution**: Created a client-side `MuiThemeProvider` component that wraps the theme logic

### 3. **Routing Architecture**
Two complete routing solutions are now available:

## Option 1: React Router (Current Implementation)
**Files:**
- `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Original component with React Router
- `src/components/App.jsx` - Router setup with placeholder pages

**Usage:**
```jsx
// In page.jsx
import App from "../components/App";
return <App />;
```

## Option 2: Next.js Routing (Recommended)
**Files:**
- `src/components/DashboardNextJS.jsx` - Dashboard using Next.js navigation
- `src/app/manage-exam/page.jsx` - Manage exam page
- `src/app/exam/page.jsx` - Take exam page

**Current Active Implementation:** Next.js routing (more appropriate for Next.js projects)

## Component Improvements

### Enhanced Styling
- Added proper flexbox layout for centering
- Improved responsive design
- Better spacing and visual hierarchy
- Consistent button sizing

### Client-Side Components
- Added `"use client"` directives where needed
- Proper Next.js App Router compatibility

## Project Structure
```
frontend/src/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.js (with MuiThemeProvider)
│   ├── page.jsx (main dashboard)
│   ├── exam/page.jsx
│   └── manage-exam/page.jsx
└── components/
    ├── Dashboard.jsx (React Router version)
    ├── DashboardNextJS.jsx (Next.js version - currently active)
    ├── App.jsx (React Router setup)
    └── ThemeProvider.jsx (client-side theme provider)
```

## Build Status
✅ All builds passing
✅ No TypeScript/linting errors
✅ Static generation working
✅ All routes functional

## How to Switch Between Routing Methods

### To use React Router:
```jsx
// In src/app/page.jsx
import App from "../components/App";
return <App />;
```

### To use Next.js routing: (Current)
```jsx
// In src/app/page.jsx
import DashboardNextJS from "../components/DashboardNextJS";
return <DashboardNextJS />;
```

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server
